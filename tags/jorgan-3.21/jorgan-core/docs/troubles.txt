jOrgan Troubleshooting Guide

* Where do I start?
The program is available in a file named jOrgan-xy.zip (where xy stands for the current version numer), please download it from:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/jorgan/files/

* What should I do with downloaded jOrgan-xy.zip file?
A zip file is a compressed collection of other files. You have to use a zip program like WinZip to extract these files to an arbitrary location of your computer. On Windows the directory 'c:\Program Files\jOrgan' should be appropriate.

* How to start the program?
Start a command line, change into the installation directory and execute the following command:
  java -cp lib\* jorgan.App

* Java is not recognized as a valid command.
jOrgan runs on Windows, Linux and OS X. To be able to support all these operation systems jOrgan is based on a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Please make sure that you have a JRE installed on your computer, this will enable you to use many other programs written in Java (see http://www.java.com).
Verify that a 1.6 compatible JRE is installed. Execute the following command to see your current Java version (output should look similar):
  java -version
    java version "1.5.0"
    Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0-b64)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0-b64, mixed mode)
